      <desc>Bei Dao mentions that before the rustication, they have already started to read extensively. First, under the influence of his classmates he read books on politics, economics and history, in order to devote his life to the revolution. After he became a builder, he started to be interested in the literary works. At that time, the most popular books were the 'neibu' books, namely yellow-covered books. Ehrenburg's work was among the most influential for Bei Dao and he read this piece many times, it opened a window that lead to a world so different from his real life.  As it seems to him now, Ehrenburg's piece is not that good, but at those times it served as a guidebook for 'searching' young people and gave them an ability to dream. Bei Dao's memoirs are cited from Jian Ying 建英 2006 (Wang Shiqiang 2014: 88).<bibl type="source" source="#W0487">
