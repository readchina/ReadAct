This repository contains the main data files for the *ReadAct* database. *ReadAct* collects data about reading habits during China's long 1970s: Who read what when with whom why under what circumstances for what purposes? What impact did this have on individuals and on Chinese society? For version `1.x` our  sources are autobiographical texts in Chinese and other languages. As of version `2.x` we added reading acts of as they occur in fictional sources. For more information, please consult our [documentation](https://readchina.github.io/readact.html).

[ReadActor](https://github.com/readchina/ReadActor) is an accompanying tool for automating [wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) lookups and data retrieval. We encourage anybody working with ReadAct to familiarize themselves with its capabilities.
